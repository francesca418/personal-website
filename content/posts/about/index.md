I'm from Sagamore Beach, MA, but I currently live in Philadelphia. 

I am passionate about technology, ethics, research, and mentorship. You can [email me](mailto:fmarini@sas.upenn.edu), and you can download my [resume]() here. If you're curious about some of my favorite things, check out my [Interests](/interests).

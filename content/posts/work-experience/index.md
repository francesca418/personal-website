# Cognitive Computation Group @ UPenn
<details>
  <summary><b>Researcher</b></summary>

*February 2019 - Present*<br>
The Cognitive Computation Group (CogComp) is one of the foremost research groups in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) run by Professor Dan Roth.

NLP is a branch of machine learning that combines linguistics with computer science to teach machines how to do tasks such as machine translation, information extraction, document summarization, and question answering (think Google search, chatbots, and recommendation systems).

I have been working as a researcher in this lab for nearly two years, both as a paid researcher and for academic credit through independent study. For more info about my research projects, please check out the Projects tab.

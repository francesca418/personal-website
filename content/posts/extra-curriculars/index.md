# Clubs & Leadership
<details>
  <summary><b>Univ. of Penn. Figure Skating Club</b></summary>

  <h3>Founding Executive Board Member</h3>
<br>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li>The <a href="https://upennfigureskating.wixsite.com/upennfigureskating" target="_blank"><b>UPenn Figure Skating Club</b></a> serves both the Penn and Drexel University student bodies. I was a member of the club's founding board. In my first year, I was <b>Treasurer</b> for the club, and for the following two years I served as <b>Show Director</b>.</li>
    <li>I have directed the production of <b>four large-scale figure skating performances</b>. This involved coordinating rehearsals for group numbers, finding costuming, managing sound and lighting on the day of the show, recruiting and managing show volunteers, devising a setlist, and serving as liason between the performers, executive board, rink management, and spectators.
</li>
    <li>Our shows are open to skaters of all levels from beginners to internationally-recognized competitors, undergraduates to university professors. We are devoted to inclusivity, and we use our funds to help defray the cost of this expensive sport for our members.</li>
    <li>As a club that receives zero funding from the university, we rely on our shows to bring in most of our funds. Each show has seen an <b>increase in attendance and profits</b>, with our latest show (pre-COVID) attracting over 300 spectators and earning over $3000. During my time on board, we have <b>grown club membership</b> from around 15 students to over 100 students. </li>

# Some Stuff I Like...

My family is very close and important to me. We are **Italian** ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, and I love to learn how to cook traditional meals from my relatives. Also, wine is a fun time.

In my free time, I love to get together with friends for movie & game nights, concerts & performances, family dinners, & late night conversations.

I LOVE to read ... everything (though I have sadly found less time to do so since starting college). I keep a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o0sN5PnltjHZpppv5xUmthnL_RWPHpU5/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">detailed catalogue</a> of my **personal library**, which I store alphabetically. (Don't ask me to pick a favorite.)

Listening to **music** and **podcasts** are some of my favorite things to do to relax. I also love drawing and **visual arts & crafts**. One of my favorite things to do in Philly is visiting the Philadelphia Museum of Art. I am also fairly advanced at knitting, and I've taken up embroidery during quarantine.

I have been **figure skating** since I was 5 and am a <a href="https://www.usfigureskating.org/skate/test-structure" target="_blank">USFS Gold Medalist</a> in Moves in the Field. 

I enjoy taking walks outdoors, especially to the beach, and I also dabble in iPhone photography. (Most of the pictures on this site were ones I took out on walks in the three places where I've spent large chunks of my life -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagamore_Beach,_Massachusetts" target="_blank">Sagamore Beach, MA</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Smyrna_Beach,_Florida" target="_blank">New Smyrna Beach, FL</a>; Philadelphia, PA.)

I am very interested in **ethics**, specifically as it relates to new technologies. Questions regarding ethical AI and algorithms, the right to privacy, regulation of big tech, public health, the environment, and big data fascinate me.

I support Boston sports teams, and I love learning about the strategy behind sports.

Thanks for checking out my site, and don't hesitate to reach out!
